        <h2>Random Programming Meme</h2>
        <p>While we're on the topic of computer science, I once found a meme about programming that I thought was highly relevant to our discussion of coding in the first LiveLab. I've decided to share that meme below:</p>

        <p>I will admit that I have definitely felt this way sometimes, and I agree with my instructors in this Accelerator that it is only natural for all programmers to have those feelings every now and then. That said, usually my annoyance or anger at debugging subsides after a bit, and I would definitely say that my passion for coding far outweighs any negative feelings I occasionally have towards it.</p>

        <h2>Hobbies: Dance</h2>
        <p>Out of my various hobbies, the one I spend the most time on is probably dancing. I am in two dance groups at college: <em>AADT</em> (which stands for <em>Asian American Dance Troupe</em>) and <em>Candela</em> (which is a Latin dance group). I have had the opportunity to try out several styles of dance, as seen in the videos below:</p>
